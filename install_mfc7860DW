from brother website: download driver install tool (for printer and scanner rather than just one of them)
move to /opt/mfcprinter
gunzip the file, this produces linux-brprinter-installer-2.2.1-1   (the gz file is replaced)

run as su:

Command: bash linux-brprinter-installer-*.*.*-* Brother machine name 
bash linux-brprinter-installer-2.2.1-1 MFC-7860DW
if machine name is not given it will ask for it

confirm the driver list

this downloads all drivers and installs them


during the process
-will you give the uri address for the printer (printer install) - Y
-choose 13 = give ip address of the scanner it is 111
on the printer the network address is set statically to 111


after the installation is complete, go to settings - printer and print a test page

===========================================================================================

it can be that the printer is installed as usb printer
in this case choose device uri - change
in the menue choose network printer
this opens a menue  
there choose find printer and type in the ip address
it comes up with a found message and a protocol suggest - confirm
then print test page

to scan install xsane
when started thsi searches for the scanner and since it was installed with ip it finds the scanner right away and scans fine.

Issues:

if it fails with a message such as "failed to start scanner - invalid argument", then delete the xsane config file
rm -rf ~/.sane/xsane
sometimes this is messed up from previous config attempts. Not even uninstall and install worked in that case, but deleting the file did.
