using the mega as isp to program the attiny85

1. install board configuration
https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829
arduino 1.68 has board manager (preferences)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json
choose the tiny (or other relevant boards for different targets)
then restart

2. prepare arduino as programmer
under examples load the program for arduinoISP
transfer to mega

3. electronics - board connections
use spi interface to transfer code, on mega use the icsp connector
some sites mention to put a 10us capacitor between gnd and reset to ovoid a reset after the serial communication has been completed
other mention to put a capcitor between 5v and reset.
others mention to put a resistor between 5v and reset.
I used a 147ohm resistor which made it work, other solutions didn't but it could also be because of board settings

the mega offeres an icsp connector : https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI
on mega use spi connector: icsp pin, function, mega chip pin
1,2	miso,vcc	50,various
3,4	sck,mosi	52,51
5,6	reset,gnd	??,various
since we need the slave select pin, it was better to connect directly
50: miso		-> pb1, pin6, miso
51: mosi		-> pb0, pin5, mosi	
52: sck			-> pb2, pin7, sck
52: ss			-> reset, pin1
VCC and GND		-> vcc pin8 and gnd pin4

tiny pin,function
4,gnd,gnd
5,0,mosi
6,1,miso
7,2,clk
8,vcc,vcc

3. prepare arduino to program the tiny
under tools:
board: Atiny
processor:tiny85
clock: 1MHZ
programmer: arduino as isp   (NOT: arduinoISP)
if different frequency than standard 1MHZ -> burn bootloader

4. programming, compilation
load blink, set the output pin to tiny pin0, compile

5. transfer to attiny
sketch-> upload using programmer
