download sloeber, unpack and place it
start sloeber and configure the arduino board
one of the items is the port name
it should be something like /dev/ttyusb0 or similar depending on where the usb cable is connected

important: connect the arduino to the usb port 
lsusb shows:
Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC

very likely the dropdown menue is empty and in the serial monitor the configuration doesn't show a usb port either


https://askubuntu.com/questions/112568/how-do-i-allow-a-non-default-user-to-use-serial-device-ttyusb0

the issue is that usb ports are in the dialout group and hence the current user needs to bee added:
sudo adduser this_user dialout

Now logout and logon start sloeber again
under project preferences the port is now availble in the dropdown

and in the serialmonitor add the port to the monitor
